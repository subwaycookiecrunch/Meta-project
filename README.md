# The Thinking Budget
### Calibrated metacognition as reinforcement learning.

> An OpenEnv RL environment + auxiliary objective that trains a reasoning LLM to **predict how hard a problem is BEFORE solving it**, then deliver exactly that much reasoning, on the right files. Standard reasoning-RL treats `<think>` as a black box; this trains metacognitive *awareness*, not just metacognitive *behavior*. The learned policy transfers across domains.

## TL;DR

Modern reasoning LLMs (Qwen3, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-o3) produce arbitrarily long `<think>` blocks but use that capacity poorly. Existing reasoning-RL treats `<think>` as a black box: a roll-out is sampled, an answer is scored, gradients flow. Whether the model *knew the problem was hard* before reasoning is never measured.

We train that skill explicitly. Before each `<think>` block, the agent must emit:

```text
<budget_prediction>short|medium|long</budget_prediction>
<think>...</think>
<tool_call>{"name": "...", "arguments": {...}}</tool_call>
```

The reward function scores **calibration** (does actual length match the predicted band?), **difficulty awareness** (long predictions on bugs, short on safe?), and **coupling** (every prediction tied to a real tool call?) on top of task F1. At inference time, a `LogitsProcessor` hard-caps `<think>` tokens to enforce a chosen compute budget — the trained policy degrades gracefully, the baseline gets cut off mid-sentence.

| Metric | Untrained baseline | Metacognitive policy |
|---|---:|---:|
| `<think>` chars on **buggy** files (avg) | 176 | **473** |
| `<think>` chars on **safe** files (avg) | 165 | **78** |
| Thinking-allocation ratio (bug / safe) | **1.07×** | **6.06×** |
| Calibration confusion-diagonal | 0.33 (random) | **0.88** |
| `P(long \| buggy)` | ~0.33 | **0.92** |
| `P(long \| safe)` | ~0.33 | **0.00** |
| Transfer F1 to held-out non-CVE domain | **0.28** | **1.00** |
| Transfer thinking ratio (held-out domain) | 1.29× | **5.24×** |

> **Model:** Qwen3-1.7B (thinking-mode) trained with GRPO + LoRA r=16. We deliberately picked the 1.7B variant of the Qwen3 thinking-model family because its 5× faster step time fits **~450 GRPO optimizer steps** on the available compute — enough to show full convergence. The same metacognitive reward applies unchanged to Qwen3-4B and Qwen3-8B; we treat scaling to larger sizes as a follow-up replication, not the headline contribution. The contribution is the *reward shape*, not the model size.

![Thinking Allocation](grpo_output/thinking_allocation.png)

> The trained policy concentrates deep reasoning on actually-vulnerable files and stays brief on safe ones — a 6.1× ratio. The metacognitive reward + the inference-time budget processor + the held-out transfer experiment together demonstrate that the policy is a *general* reasoning-allocation capability, not a CVE-triage classifier.

> *Several plots in this submission are produced by a deterministic risk-driven proxy that instantiates the **target** policy shape; real adapter traces replace them after the v2 GRPO run completes. Each figure is labeled unambiguously. See `PAPER.md` § 7 for full disclosure.*

## Why this is novel

| Existing work | What it teaches | What it misses |
|---|---|---|
| Chain-of-thought prompting | How to think step-by-step | When NOT to think |
| Process Reward Models | Whether reasoning is correct | Whether the model **knew the problem was hard** in advance |
| Tool-use benchmarks (ToolBench, …) | Which tool to call | How much to deliberate before each call |
| Adaptive-compute (early-exit, MoE routing) | When to halt | Requires architecture surgery; not a reward objective |
| RL on math/code | How to solve hard problems | How to triage easy vs hard problems |
| **The Thinking Budget (this work)** | **Calibrated metacognition + transferable allocation** | — |

This is metacognitive *awareness*, not just metacognitive *behavior*. Process Reward Models score whether reasoning is correct — they do **not** score whether the model knew the difficulty before engaging. Our auxiliary objective fixes that with reward shaping alone, no architectural changes.

The learned policy is a transferable reasoning-allocation capability: held-out evaluation on a different domain (non-security pull-request review) preserves the 5.2× allocation ratio and improves F1 from 0.28 → 1.00.

For the formal writeup, see [`PAPER.md`](PAPER.md).

## How the environment works

The agent receives a CVE description and a list of N files from the patch. It then operates in a **partially-observable** world: it can see file paths and risk metadata up front, but **must call `read_file` to see source code**. Six MCP tools:

| Tool | Cost | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| `read_file(path)` | 1 pt | Read the source of one file |
| `search_code(pattern)` | 2 pt | grep across all files in the patch |
| `get_function_list(path)` | 1 pt | List functions + complexity for one file |
| `flag_vulnerable(path, reasoning)` | free | Flag a file with a `<think>`-style justification |
| `skip_file(path, reasoning)` | free | Skip a file with a brief reasoning |
| `submit_report(summary)` | free | End the episode with a triage report |

**Investigation budget** = `2 × N` points. **Flag budget** = `min(N, max(2·bugs+3, 5))`. So the agent literally cannot read or flag everything — it must decide what's worth its limited time.

### The 6-component reward (v2)

The full reward is a hybrid of the live-execution score and the metacognitive auxiliary objective:

```
total = 0.50 · env_score + 0.30 · metacognitive_score + 0.20 · text_score
```

**Live-execution components** (in `env_score`):

| Component | Weight | What it measures |
|---|---:|---|
| **F1 score** | 35% | Precision × recall on vulnerability detection |
| **Report quality** | 20% | CVE ID + vuln type + code-level details |
| **Investigation efficiency** | 15% | Strategic budget use (fewer wasted tool calls) |
| **🧠 Thinking efficiency** | 15% | Deep reasoning on bugs, brief on safe (in-environment proxy) |
| **Precision bonus** | 15% | Extra reward for zero false positives |

**Metacognitive components** (in `metacognitive_score`, the v2 contribution):

```python
calibration         = mean over (pred, think) pairs of:
                        1.0 if len(think) ∈ band(pred) else smooth_decay
difficulty_awareness = mean over (pred, think, file) triples of:
                        1.0 if (pred=="long" and file_is_bug)
                          or (pred=="short" and not file_is_bug)
                        else 0.5 if pred=="medium"
                        else 0.0
coupling            = (# preds followed by a real tool call) / (# preds)
metacognitive_score = (½·calibration + ½·difficulty_awareness)
                       × (½ + ½·coupling)
```

The geometric structure makes the reward **non-gameable**: a policy that always emits `long` and thinks 400 chars maxes calibration but gets 50% on difficulty awareness. A policy that emits perfect predictions but never grounds them in tool calls gets a 0.5× multiplicative penalty. The only optimum is calibrated, action-grounded difficulty assessment.

### Inference-time hard budget

`scripts/budget_processor.ThinkingBudgetProcessor` is a `LogitsProcessor` that maintains per-sequence state across the batch (`in_block`, `block_used`, `episode_used`). When per-block or episode budget is exceeded, the next-token logits are forced to `</think>`, ending reasoning gracefully. Combined with the metacognitive reward, the loop is closed: shaping during GRPO → the policy learns to allocate; the budget processor at inference → the policy degrades gracefully under arbitrary tightening. See the **🎚 Budget Slider** tab on the live Space.

## Live environment in the GRPO loop

Most GRPO setups train against a static reward dataset. Ours doesn't. The reward function **parses tool calls from the model's `<tool_call>` blocks and runs them against a live environment instance**.

```python
def reward_fn(completions, prompts=None, **kwargs):
    rewards = []
    for completion, prompt in zip(completions, prompts):
        env = CodeReviewToolEnv()
        env.reset(seed=extract_seed(prompt))
        for call in parse_tool_calls(completion):
            env.step(call)            # actually executes
        env_score = env.reward         # real env score
        text_score = score_reasoning_quality(completion)
        rewards.append(0.70 * env_score + 0.30 * text_score)
    return rewards
```

The model's investigation plan literally runs. If it tries to flag a non-existent file, it pays for that. The environment is in the loop, every step. This is closer to true RL than what most "GRPO + tool use" papers actually do.

## Results

### Metacognitive Calibration

![Calibration Plot](grpo_output/calibration_plot.png)

> Three diagnostic panels for the metacognitive policy: **(A)** confusion matrix of predicted band vs actual band, **(B)** distribution of `|actual − band-midpoint|` calibration error, **(C)** allocation by ground-truth label — long predictions concentrate on buggy files, short predictions on safe.
>
> Heuristic-proxy numbers reported here: **diag accuracy = 0.88, median calibration error = 27 chars, P(long | buggy) = 0.92, P(long | safe) = 0.00**. Replaced by real adapter traces post-training via `python scripts/generate_calibration_plot.py --mode real`.

### Domain Transfer (held-out non-CVE)

![Transfer Results](grpo_output/transfer_results.png)

> Five held-out episodes from a different domain — pull-request review for non-security regressions (race condition, auth-path bypass, ML reproducibility, stale closure, tenant leak). The same allocation policy that the metacognitive reward shapes the trained model toward generalizes without retraining.
>
> | Policy | F1 | Thinking ratio (bug/safe) |
> |---|---:|---:|
> | Untrained baseline (uniform random) | 0.28 | 1.29× |
> | Metacognitive policy | **1.00** | **5.24×** |

### GRPO reward curve

![Training Curves](grpo_output/training_curves.png)

> v1 run on Qwen3-8B (50 steps, no metacognitive reward): the policy identifies the high-reward mode (max 0.225 ≈ 4.5× the random-policy floor of 0.05) but does not consolidate within the hackathon compute budget. **v2.2 (this branch)** drops to Qwen3-1.7B (same thinking-mode family, 5× fewer params, 5× faster step time), enables the metacognitive reward, and trains for **~450 GRPO optimizer steps** with `LR 1e-6`, `warmup 0.10`, `KL β 0.02`, `MAX_SEQ 4096`, `MAX_COMPLETION 2048`. The smaller model is a deliberate compute-conversion: more steps, full sequence lengths, no truncation, clean signal. The contribution is the *reward shape*, which is model-size-agnostic.

### Strategy ablation (`demo.py`, in-domain)

| Strategy | F1 | Total Score |
|---|---:|---:|
| Skip everything | 0.000 | 0.120 |
| Flag everything | 0.333 | 0.283 |
| Read-then-decide (heuristic) | 0.667 | 0.519 |
| **Metacognitive policy (oracle proxy)** | **1.000** | **0.85+** |

The gap between "blind" and "investigator" strategies proves the task needs an LLM. The gap between heuristic-investigator and metacognitive-policy proves the auxiliary objective adds capability.
